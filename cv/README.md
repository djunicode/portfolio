Unicode.cv
  
        Unicode.cv is my first project using javascript and json.
I have used html and css to make the page stylish and attractive. All my data is stored in a file named resume.json which i have made on gitgist.
I have basically seen many resume formats on google and have taken ideas from different formats and written the code from scratch. The web page is resposive and can work on all devices.
